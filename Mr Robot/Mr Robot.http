At night, he hacks social media, personal information, and bank records, including those of his co-workers, therapist, and a drug dealer. Elliot stops a DDoS attack against Allsafe's biggest client, E Corp. He identifies a file labeled fsociety00.dat and a text file asking him not to destroy malware he finds hidden on E Corp's server. Mr. Robot, the mysterious leader of the hacker group fsociety, contacts Elliot on the subway. Fsociety invites Elliot to join them in starting a digital revolution; they plan to delete all debt records held by E Corp. He is intrigued and eventually agrees. As his first collaborative act with fsociety, Elliot provides the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with an encrypted file falsely implicating Terry Colby, E Corp's chief technology officer (CTO) as the orchestrator of the attack.",

When Elliot notices Fernando Vera, Shayla's supplier, abusing her, Elliot collects evidence against Fernando and turns him in to the police, despite Shayla's explicit instructions not to. Meanwhile, Cisco, an unknown associate of the Chinese hacker group The Dark Army, hacks Ollie's home computer with a compact disc (CD). Elliot and Mr. Robot discuss Elliot's falling out with his father: Elliot told his mother of his father's terminal illness, despite promising his father he would keep the illness secret.

        "Description": "Elliot has a new plan to destroy E Corp's tape back-ups of their data at Steel Mountain involving hacking into their climate control system by connecting a Raspberry Pi to slowly raise the temperature (bypassing the climate control system) to a point where it will destroy the magnetic tape back-ups, but this requires physical access to the heavily fortified data center. Elliot, Romero, Mobley, and Mr. Robot go to Steel Mountain. With his morphine supply cut off, Elliot starts to have serious withdrawal symptoms including multiple hallucinations. Darlene and Trenton stay behind to contact Darlene's ex-boyfriend Cisco and arrange a simultaneous hacker attack by the Dark Army on E Corp's backup sites in China. Meanwhile, Angela and Shayla do ecstasy which results in the two kissing. The next morning, Angela sabotages Allsafe using Ollie's work ID and computer.",

Tyrell reveals he knows that Elliot framed the CTO, but will not turn him in. The Dark Army refuses to attack the back-up facility in China, which puts fsociety's plan in jeopardy.
