      "description": "Socially inept Elliot Alderson works at cyber security company Allsafe. At night, he hacks social media, personal information, and bank records, including those of his co-workers, therapist, and a drug dealer. Elliot stops a DDoS attack against Allsafe's biggest client, E Corp. He identifies a file labeled fsociety00.dat and a text file asking him not to destroy malware he finds hidden on E Corp's server. Mr. Robot, the mysterious leader of the hacker group fsociety, contacts Elliot on the subway. Fsociety invites Elliot to join them in starting a digital revolution; they plan to delete all debt records held by E Corp. He is intrigued and eventually agrees. As his first collaborative act with fsociety, Elliot provides the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with an encrypted file falsely implicating Terry Colby, E Corp's chief technology officer (CTO) as the orchestrator of the attack.",

Mr. Robot encourages him to keep his eyes forward until he is ready to wake up in the hospital. Ray lets him know that he is Elliot's master. Upon being locked away by Lone Star, Elliot hugs Mr. Robot for protecting his mind during the beating.

The United States Congress refuses to move forward with Phillip Price's bailout plan to borrow from China because four FBI agents were killed there. Darlene and Mobley coach Angela through hacking the FBI, but Dominique appears just before she can finish.",

      "description": "Elliot tells Darlene that nothing, from drugs to therapy to voluntarily placing himself in jail, is keeping Mr. Robot at bay, saying that the world falling apart around him is his fault. He puts his affairs in order by giving his dog to his neighbor, throwing his Mr. Robot jacket away, and going to Trenton and Mobley's families to pay his respects. Elliot buys a lethal amount of morphine pills and heads to Coney Island to commit suicide, but is deterred by Mohammad, Trenton's younger brother, whom Elliot is forced to look after when his parents leave him alone. After Mohammad leaves a movie that Elliot takes him to and goes to a mosque, he is confronted by Elliot, who admits that he wishes he was dead. After dropping Mohammad back off at his home, he goes to Angela's apartment and reminds her of a 'wishing game' they used to play as kids, which gives Elliot the will to live. After arriving home, getting the jacket back, and reinstalling his computer, he notices a message sent from Trenton before her death saying that there is a way to undo the hack.",

      "description": "Elliot wakes up in an abandoned lot following the explosion at the Washington Township plant, which is no longer there. He discovers the town is a thriving suburbia, where his mother and father, both alive, live. He finds out that his parents never abused him as a child and that Darlene does not exist. He returns to the city, where he encounters Angela's parents, Emily and Phillip (the latter still being in Angela's life), and they reveal to him that Elliot is marrying Angela the following day. He goes to the alternate Elliot's apartment and hacks his computer, discovering a hidden drive of sketches of himself, Darlene, and the rest of fsociety. The alternate Elliot returns home to find the original Elliot at his iMac (as depicted at the end of the previous episode). Initially alarmed, the alternate Elliot explains that the sketches are of a persona he created that would lead an exciting life as a vigilante hacker, the very life the original Elliot lives. They touch, causing another earthquake, which severely injures the alternate Elliot. Alternate Elliot gets a call from Angela; hearing her for the first time since her death, the original Elliot decides that he can have the life he always wanted and kills the alternate Elliot.",

      "description": "Elliot hides the alternate Elliot's body in a storage container, intent on taking the alternate Elliot's place and marrying Angela. A police officer, Dominique, attempts to arrest Elliot after she discovers the alternate Elliot's body. Elliot escapes to Coney Island, where he discovers that there was no wedding. Mr. Robot explains to Elliot that the world they are in is not the parallel world Whiterose spoke of, but rather an illusion created by Elliot with the intention of keeping \"the real Elliot\" trapped. Bewildered and confused, Elliot wakes up in Krista's office. Krista (who is a manifestation of Elliot's mind at this point) explains that the Elliot we have known since the beginning of the series is not the real Elliot, but a persona called \"The Mastermind\" that the real Elliot created to deal with his rage and anger at the world. However, this persona decided to take over and trapped the real Elliot in the Utopian world, getting rid of Darlene, who is the real Elliot's strongest connection to reality; Krista explains that the Mastermind must give control back to the real Elliot, but he refuses as the world collapses. The Mastermind wakes up in the hospital, where Darlene reveals that Whiterose is dead, her machine was destroyed, and she knew that the Mastermind had taken over. Accepting his identity, the Mastermind returns to Elliot's mind with the rest of his personas. The real Elliot wakes up in the hospital and is greeted by Darlene.",
